/*
  # Fix RLS policies to explicitly target anon role
  
  1. Problem
    - Policies created with `TO public` are not being applied to the `anon` role in Supabase PostgREST
    - This causes all table counts to return 0 when queried via the Supabase JS client (anon key)
  
  2. Solution
    - Drop all `TO public` dev mode policies
    - Recreate them with `TO anon, authenticated` so both roles can access data
  
  3. Tables affected
    - audit_entities, audit_engagements, audit_findings, workpapers, audit_steps
    - action_plans, reports, risk_library, audit_plans, finding_history
    - review_notes, program_templates, workpaper_findings, user_profiles, tenants
    - compliance_regulations
